# All Missing Features Restored âœ…

## Summary of Features Added Back

I analyzed the original home screen files and identified all missing functionality, then restored them to the working app.

### âœ… **Features Successfully Restored:**

#### **1. Note Sharing Functionality**
- **Added:** `share_plus` import to `lib/widgets/editor_header.dart`
- **Added:** Share button in editor header with share icon
- **Function:** Users can now share notes (title + content) via system share sheet
- **Location:** Share button appears next to preview/math toggle buttons

#### **2. Localized Demo Content**
- **Added:** `AppLocalizations` import to `lib/screens/home_screen_fixed.dart`
- **Added:** `_showDemoNote()` method that creates demo with localized content
- **Function:** Demo note uses `loc.demoTitle` and `loc.demoContent` from app localizations
- **Behavior:** Demo note can be re-shown if deleted, focuses existing demo if present

#### **3. Interactive Walkthrough**
- **Added:** `_showWalkthrough()` method with 4-page guided tour
- **Added:** Keyboard shortcut support (Cmd/Ctrl + H)
- **Function:** Multi-page dialog explaining app features:

  - "Show Walkthrough" - Opens guided tour
- **Icons:** Lightbulb for demo, help outline for walkthrough

#### **5. First-Time User Experience**
- **Added:** Auto-show demo and walkthrough on first app launch
- **Logic:** 
  - Checks `demo_shown_v1` and `walkthrough_shown_v1` preferences
  - Creates localized demo note on first run
  - Shows walkthrough after demo insertion (one-time only)
  - Uses `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` for proper timing
